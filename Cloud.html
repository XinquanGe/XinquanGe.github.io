<p>"Cloud" is essentially a network. Users can access resources on the cloud at any time. As long as you pay by usage, <br>the "cloud" can be seen as infinitely scalable.</p>

<p>
Cloud computing is not a new network technology, but a new network application concept. So that everyone who <br>uses the Cloud can use the huge computing resources and data center on the network.</p>
The most common cloud computing application in our life should <br>be cloud storage. Cloud storage not only liberates users' insufficient <br>local storage, but also makes data more secure and not easy to lose. <br>In addition, cloud computing is also used in the work. By using cloud <br>computing, the concept of office is weakened. Maybe in the future, <br>we can work at home every day.

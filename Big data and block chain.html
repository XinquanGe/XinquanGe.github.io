The application of big data makes the transmission and collection of information faster and can save more information. This benefits from <br>the development of digitization and computers. But at the same time, big data also brings problems and doubts. Big data is relatively fuzzy <br>and contains some false information. The opacity of information content also makes many people question the information security of big <br>data. At this time, blockchain gives us an answer.</p>
<p>
Blockchain originated from bitcoin. Blockchain is a shared account book and database, which has the characteristics of non-tampering, tracing, <br>openness and transparency. The source and destination of information are completely transparent. If blockchain and big data are used together, <br>users' data can be controlled by themselves. </p>
<p>
Big data and blockchain can be used in many places, such as network security, artificial intelligence. One of the most noteworthy is the medical <br>record and healthcare. All medical records are clearly visible, and all changes and interpretations to the records are maintained in a transparent <br>manner. At the same time, personalize healthcare and create best practices for working with consumers or patients. Everyone can benefit from it.
